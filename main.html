<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity</p>
	<p>O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its <b>space complexity</b> grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>
